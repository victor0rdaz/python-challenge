# python-challenge

Create a new GitHub repo called python-challenge. Then, clone it to your computer.
In your local Git repository, create a directory for both of the Python activities. Name the folders PyBank and PyRamen.
In both the PyBank and PyRamen folders, add a new file called main.ipynb. Remember to use JupyterLab to correctly generate the .ipynb file format. This will be the main notebook to run for each analysis.
Push these changes to the repository that you created in Step 1
In this assignment, you will create a Python script that analyzes the financial records of your company.  Inside your starter code, you will find a financial dataset in the budget_data.csv file. This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting, so the records are simple.)
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period
The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
Your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

Your final script should print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
